# k8s-codis

Inspired by https://github.com/kevinz/k8s-codis. However, kevin's project seems a little old as codis has changed a lot. Besides, there isn't existing docker image to use, and users have to build the images themselves. So here comes this project, which I planned to use hub.c.163.com as the registry.
